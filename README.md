 ## Description 

  Employee tracker is an inquirer based SQL database poromt app that allows a business to store track and modify thier employees information. There are 3 main tables that can be adjusted based on the size or demand for the business. Each employee will display a first and last name along with the department they work for. In addition, it will display thier salary and the manager they work for (if applicable). The user, will be able to change the infomation on an employee and reassign thier department or role. Departments, roles and employees can be added, changed or removed at any time. .

  As workspaces grow, the need to have a simple and reproducable centralized location for employee data is impairative. Depending on the business, it may be more important for employees to find other employees or contact information for them. It is also very important for certain departments to be able to easily gather this information on an employee that may be moving on or into a new role. Fast growing businesses are likely to hire within in order to fill a postion wether intrim or perminant. .

  This is a very simple application that can store this information in a database that is secure along with readily available incase this info is needed in a time sensitive matter or by a new managing director that needs access to this information. With credentials of course!  I belive this application stands out simply from the simpliciy and intuitive nature of the app..

  Where to start. This was a great way to really hone my skills on routing and database storage. Sequalize  makes SQL so much easier to use.  It also really helped me with the relationship of different files. I.e. how you can separate files and blocks of code to make it more scalable..

  ## Installation
  First, you will clone the repository. Once that is complete, open your terminal and type 'npm init -y' followed by 'npm i' to install all necessary packages. NEXT, you will open the conncetion.js file under the db folder and enter your own MYSQL password. NEXT, you will open mysql in the terminal running the command [mysql -u root -p], enter YOUR password. Once mysql is open, run the following 3 codes. [source db/db.sql] [source db/schema.sql] [source db/seeds.sql] followed by 'quit'. Then all there is left to do is in your integrated terminal, 'node start'. You have successfuly installed and ready to start using employee-tracker. .

  ## Usage

  I see the ideal person being an HR representitive or high level director that needs access to this information. More importantly, being able to move, add or change employee roles and information. Depending on the size of an organization, there could be multiple employees monthly that are getting raises, moving to new roles or potentially entirely new departments being created. What a simple way to handle all of this information.

  ## Contribution

  It would be great if I could get a comment on the file if used and also a comment to my linkedIn as well. It would be fantastic to get both positive and constructive input on this project. I always aim to do better. I am new in this world of coding and know things are always changing and advancing. Let alone the copius ammount of new languages and libraries at our disposal..

  ## Tests

  No formal tests completed for this. Just a ridiculous amount of testing failing code to get it to work properly.
